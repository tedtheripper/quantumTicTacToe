Welcome, this is a simple step-by-step guide on how to play my quantum tic tac toe game
1. Before starting the game
    - First it is necesarry to read on the internet about this type of tic tac toe game
	because it differs a lot from the standard version
    - Wikipedia page might be helpful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tic-tac-toe
    - Make sure you have python3 installed on your computer
	You can download the latest version on: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - If you have git installed on your computer clone this repository using git clone
	https://github.com/tedtheripper/quantumTicTacToe.git
    - Otherwise you can download .zip file to your machine and unpack it
	https://github.com/tedtheripper/quantumTicTacToe/archive/master.zip
2. Starting the game
    - You have to decide if you want to compete against computer player 
	or just play with your friend (in extreme circumstances with yourself)
    - To play with a computer player simply write 'python3 game.py computer' in your command line in src folder
    - To run it without computer player turned on, just double click game.py file or run 'python3 game.py' command
    - If you run in any issue feel free to add them in the issues section on the github page
3. Playing the game
    - You are welcomed with a well known, simple 3x3 board. 
	The label on the top shows whose turn is currently undergoing
    - Moves are made by clicking on the chosen squares
    - If cycle is created, pop-up message will be displayed 
    - The message tells which player gets to choose square and element of the collapse
    - After pressing OK, new buttons will appear on the right
    - First you have to choose the square where the collapse is going to start
    - After you choose one, the second row of buttons will appear
	NOTE! At this time you are still able to change your square of choice
    - Then choose the element you would like to keep in this square and let the game handle the rest
    - Now go ahead and make more moves to win the game
4. Ending the game
    - If there is a win or a draw, pop-up message will be displayed
    - In quantum version there is an option when both players win, but the rules say which one will be awarded more points

Thank you for choosing my game
